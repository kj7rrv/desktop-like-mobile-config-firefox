# desktop-like-mobile-config-firefox

Mobile friendly configuration for Firefox >= 91, based on
https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/mobile-config-firefox/-/tree/master.

This does not replace a proper implementation in
[Firefox upstream](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1579348)
*(interesting stuff happens in issues linked in "References")*.

## What this config does

* Adapt UI elements and "about:" pages to small screen sizes (when opened on
  small screen)
* Enable mobile gestures
* User agent set to same as Tor Browser for Android
* Privacy tweaks:
  * Disable Firefox studies
  * Disable Telemetry
  * Set DuckDuckGo as default search engine
* Uncluttering:
  * Disable built-in advertisements (e.g. hardcoded links for certain social
    media sites on the start page)
  * Disable "User Messaging" about new features etc.

There's a
[screenshot thread](https://fosstodon.org/web/@ollieparanoid/107394745970284867)
of the `3.0.0_rc1` release.

## For users: making changes

As user, it is possible to override all options set by this project. Usually it
can be done in the preferences (which are now adaptive, so you can actually use
them on your phone).

If it cannot be changed in preferences, look in
`/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json`. You can see the active policies while
Firefox is running in `about:policies`. The uBlock origin add-on for example,
is getting installed through `policies.json` and can be removed in that file
if you do not want it. Without editing the file, it can only be disabled in the
add-on settings, and not removed, this is a limitation of `policies.json`.

Feel free to
[create an issue](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/mobile-config-firefox/-/issues)
if you run into problems. Or even better, attempt to fix the problem yourself
(see development instructions below) and submit a
[merge request](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/mobile-config-firefox/-/merge_requests).

## Contributing changes to userChrome
Firefox' developer tools include a
[remote debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Remote_Debugging),
which even has the "pick an element" feature. You will be able to click that
button on your PC, then tap on an element of the Firefox UI on your phone, and
then you will see the HTML code and CSS properties on your PC just as if it was
a website. So this is highly recommended when contributing changes to
`userChrome.css`.

* Connect your phone and your PC to the same network (Wi-Fi or USB network)
* On your phone, open Firefox and `about:config`:
  * Change `devtools.chrome.enabled` to `true`
  * Change `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` to `true`
  * The debugger will only listen on localhost by default. If you know what you
    are doing, you may set `devtools.debugger.force-local` to `false`, so it
    listens on all interfaces. Otherwise you'll need something like an SSH
    tunnel.
  * Close firefox
* Connect to your phone via SSH
  * Set up environment variables properly, so you can start programs (one lazy
    way to do it, is `tmux` on your phone in the terminal, then `tmux a` in
    SSH)
  * Run `firefox --start-debugger-server 6000` (or another port if you desire)
* Run Firefox on your PC
  * Go to `about:debugging`
  * Add your phone as "network location"
  * Press the connect button on the left
  * If it does not work, check if a firewall on your phone is blocking the port
    (i.e. nftables in postmarketOS).
* On your phone
  * Confirm the connection on your phone's screen
    * If the button is not visible on the screen, try switching to a terminal
      virtual keyboard, hit "tab" three times and then return
* On your PC
  * Scroll down to Processes, Main Process, and click "Inspect"
  * Now use the "Pick an element" button as described in the introduction. Find
    the `userChrome.css` file in the "Style editor" tab and edit it as you
    like.
  * Consider copy pasting the contents to a text editor every now and then, so
    you don't lose it when closing Firefox by accident.

Note that after making changes to CSS files, and deploying them on your
system (`make install`), you might need to restart firefox _twice_ before
changes are applied.

## Coding guidelines

* Don't make longer lines than 79 columns where possible (like in PEP-8)
* Use 4 spaces for indent in all files, except for shell scripts (use tabs
  there). Consider configuring your editor to use `.editorconfig`, then it gets
  configured automatically.
* Linter: `.ci/lint.sh` (consider setting it as pre-commit hook, requires GNU
  grep)
