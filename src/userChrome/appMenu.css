     *   on one page, without scrolling. (Scrolling was only possible with the
     *   scrollbar on the right anyway, which is awkward when expecting to be
     *   able to scroll with fingers.)
     * - submenus are hidden, because attempting to scroll inside them with the
     *   finger causes firefox to segfault. This is likely due to the menu
     *   positioning hack above, looks like FF can't determine the height
     *   properly. Help with fixing this is appreciated, the bookmarks and
     *   history submenus would be useful. However even without the submenus,
     *   the history and saved bookmarks can at least be accessed conveniently
     *   through the navigation search.
     * - fullscreen is hidden: not available in FF for android either, the
     *   screen is almost used completely already, causes problems with UIs
     *   that don't expect apps to go fullscreen (i.e. in Phosh, as soon as
     *   the on screen keyboard is triggered, the top and bottom bars of Phosh
     *   are over the FF in fullscreen) */
